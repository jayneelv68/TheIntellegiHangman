Abstract: The Hangman is a word guessing game. In which a word from a list of popular words is given to the player. In the given free trials the player has to guess the word. Player is only provided with vowels only and the remaining consonants are to be guessed by the player in given fixed trials. The game will record the data like which user has played how many games and how many times he is succeeded in guessing the right word. Based on the total number of games played and number of winning games the difficulty level of the player will increase. Once the level increases user will get all the higher level words which are quite difficult to guess. For making this training successful all the words from wordlist are to be played once so that the difficulty measure of the word is derived and based on the difficulty level of the word, the users with higher levels are offered accordingly.
